Deca is a CHIP-8 interpreter backend written in Rust. It doesn't have any I/O capabilities, and is meant to be embedded in a GUI application, like [Termin-8](https://crates.io/crates/termin-8).

Deca aims to behave as closely to [Octo](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Octo)/[C-Octo](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/c-octo) as possible.

Why "`deca`"?
-------------

Deca is inspired by (heavily based on) [Octo](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Octo), which has an octopus as a mascot (as a reference to CHIP-8). Octopi are eight-limbed molluscs belonging to the order Octopoda. Deca is written in Rust, which has a crab as its mascot. Crabs are ten-limbed crustaceans of the order Decapoda.

To further justify the silly name, I plan to add support for [CHIP-10](https://chip-8.github.io/extensions/#chip-10) as well.
